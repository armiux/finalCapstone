Description
The USArrests dataset analysis project aims to understand the patterns and relationships among the various states in the US based on their crime statistics. The dataset includes four columns: Murder, Assault, UrbanPop, and Rape, which represent the number of arrests per 100,000 residents for different crimes. The project is important because it helps to identify the states that are in need of extra policing and security measures, which can lead to a decrease in crime rates and increased public safety.

The code first reads the USArrests dataset into a pandas data frame and sets the index as the city column. The data is then explored using various statistical and visual methods to gain insights into its properties. The mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values of each column are calculated and displayed. The histograms of each column are plotted to visualize the distributions of the data. A heatmap is also used to visualize the correlations between the variables.

The project then uses two clustering algorithms: K-means and Agglomerative Clustering to identify the groups of states that have similar crime statistics. The number of clusters is determined using the elbow plot and the dendrogram is plotted using different linkage methods to visualize the relationship between the states. The final step is to assign the clusters to the data and add a new column for the cluster label. The project ends by displaying the first five rows of the data frame with the cluster label column.
